Hi, Jan,


Attached is a tar file containing 2-column ascii versions of the high-res spectra for

CN 3874, Ca II 3933, Ca I 4226, CH 4300, Na I 5895, and K I 7698 that I have for omi Per,

zet Per, sig Sco, and zet Oph.  The file files.txt gives the instrumental FWHM (in km/s)

for each spectrum.  The CH spectra denoted "cls" are from Crane et al. 1995; the

K I spectra denoted "lf" were obtained by Lemoine & Ferlet with the UHRF (but

they donated them to our 2001 K I survey).  The spectra denoted "kxx" were

obtained with the KPNO coude feed, "mxx" were obtained with the McDonald

double-pass, and "axx" were obtained with the AAT UHRF.  Some of the component

structures have been listed in our high-res surveys.  Note that there may be slight

velocity zero point offsets (of order 0.1-0.3 km/s) for some of the spectra. 


The rest wavelengths, f-values, and Gamma values that I have used are

3874.468  CN_BSXSv  2.030e-2  1.610e+7   (R1)
3874.607  CN_BSXS0  3.380e-2  1.610e+7   (R0)

3933.6614 Ca_II  6.267e-1  1.444e+8  M03

4226.728  Ca_I   1.770e00  2.200e+8  M03

4300.3132 CH_ADXP0  5.060e-3  1.000e+8  G93 (mean of lambda-doubled comps)
4300.3032 CH_ADXP0  2.530e-3  1.000e+8  G93
4300.3233 CH_ADXP0  2.530e-3  1.000e+8  G93 

5895.9108 Na_I_D1  1.226e-1  6.280e+7  WHK
5895.9321 Na_I_D1  2.044e-1  6.280e+7  WHK
5895.9242 Na_I_D1  3.270e-1  6.280e+7  M03 (mean of hyperfine comps)

7698.9682 K_I_1   1.272e-1  3.820e+7  WHK
7698.9775 K_I_1   2.121e-1  3.820e+7  WHK
7698.974  K_I_1    3.393e-1  3.820e+7  WHK (mean of hyperfine comps)

If you send me the corresponding EDIBLES profiles, I can fit them with my code,

for comparison.


Let me know if you have any questions,


Dan

Dear Dan,

Thank you for your response and for sharing your site! Wow, what a
treasure trove!

For the benchmarking, I'm thinking that it would be best if we pick out
perhaps 2-3 different targets for which we have both high-resolution and
medium-resolution observations, and for which we have EDIBLES spectra in
addition to your data. That should be insightful I believe. There is
probably no need to go for very saturated lines (although that's
probably wishful thinking for the Na D lines) or for very confusing
sightlines. I have not used any of the other pieces of software for
Voigt profile fitting, so I'm new to the game....

So from having a look at the high-res observations, I'm thinking perhaps
sigma Sco and zeta Per to start with. You know the sightlines a lot
better than I do though so if you feel there would be better choices,
let me know!

Thanks again!

Jan
